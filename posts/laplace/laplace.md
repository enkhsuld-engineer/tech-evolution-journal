This mini paper explains the mathematical foundation and engineering application of the Laplace Transform.
It focuses on how the transform converts time-domain differential equations into algebraic expressions in the 
s-domain, enabling analysis of system stability, transient, and steady-state responses.
Key concepts include fundamental signals, transform properties, differentiation and integration rules.
