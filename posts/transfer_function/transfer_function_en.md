This mini paper introduces the mathematical basis and engineering significance of the **Transfer Function**.  
It explains how a system’s input–output relationship, originally expressed through time-domain differential equations, is converted into an algebraic ratio in the **s-domain** using the Laplace Transform.  
This abstraction enables streamlined analysis of system dynamics—stability, poles and zeros, transient behavior, steady-state accuracy, and controller design.
